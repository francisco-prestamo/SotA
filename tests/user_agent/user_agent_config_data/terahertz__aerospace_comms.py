To achieve ubiquitous connectivity in nextgeneration networks through aerospace communications while
maintaining high data rates, Terahertz (THz) band communications (0.1-10 THz) with large continuous bandwidths are
considered a promising candidate technology. However, key
enabling techniques and practical implementations of THz communications for aerospace applications remain limited. In this
paper, the wireless channel characteristics, enabling communication techniques, and networking strategies for THz aerospace
communications are investigated, aiming to assess their feasibility
and encourage future research efforts toward system realization.
Specifically, the wireless channel characteristics across various altitudes and scenarios are first analyzed, focusing on modeling the
interaction between the THz wave and the external environment,
from ground to outer space. Next, key enabling communication
technologies, including multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technique, beam alignment and tracking, integrated communication and radar sensing (ICARS), and resource allocation for
networking are discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and
possible future directions are summarized and discussed.
