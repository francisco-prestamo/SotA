Research suggests a link between cyclical mastalgia and factors like serum prolactin and oestradiol levels. Dietary factors, such as fat intake and the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P/S ratio), may also play a role. The Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire is used to assess menstrual symptoms, which are associated with conditions like Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS).\nThe analysis focuses on breast pain (mastalgia), exploring its causes and potential influencing factors based on provided text snippets. The primary focus is on hormonal fluctuations, diet, and menstrual cycle influence. \nBreast pain is a common condition with multiple causes including hormonal changes, menstrual cycle, and dietary factors. Hormonal fluctuations, especially those related to the menstrual cycle and factors like prolactin and oestradiol levels play a role. Dietary fat intake and P/S ratio may also be associated.\nHormonal fluctuations beyond the menstrual cycle, such as from medications or medical conditions, can cause breast pain.\nThe relationship between P/S ratio in the diet and breast pain severity is not addressed in the given snippets.",
