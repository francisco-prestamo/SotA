RESEARCH DESCRIPTION:
{research_description}

AVAILABLE SCRAPERS:
{scraper_descriptions}

TASK:
Analyze the research description and determine which scrapers would be most effective for finding relevant academic content. For each scraper, evaluate:

1. **Relevance**: Does this scraper's content domain align with the research topic?
2. **Coverage**: Will this scraper likely contain the type of documents needed?
3. **Quality**: Does this scraper provide access to high-quality, peer-reviewed sources?
4. **Specificity**: Is this scraper specialized enough to find targeted research?

SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Choose scrapers that best match the research domain and methodology described
- Prioritize academic databases and repositories for scholarly research
- Consider both broad coverage and specialized sources when appropriate
- Avoid scrapers that are clearly irrelevant to the research focus

INSTRUCTIONS:
For each scraper, decide whether it should be used (true) or not (false), and provide a concise reasoning for your decision. Focus on how well each scraper aligns with the specific research needs described.

Return your response as a JSON object following this exact schema:
{result_schema.model_json_schema()}

Ensure your reasoning is specific to why each scraper would or would not be valuable for this particular research description."""
